// This pattern is creating pointers or values that correspond to an index or position and move towards the beginning, end, or middle based on a certain condition
// very efficient for solving problems w/ minimal space complexity as well

// Example:
// write a function called sumZero which accepts a sorted array of integers.
// The function should find the first pair of where the sum is 0
// Return an array that includes both values that sum to zero or undefined if a pair does not exist
