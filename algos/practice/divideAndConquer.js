// This pattern involes dividing a data set into smaller chunks and then repeating a process w/ a subset of data
// This pattern can tremendously decrease time complexity

// Ex: Quick Sort and Merge Sort

// Example:
// Given a sorted array of integers, write a function called search, that accepts a value and returns the index where the value passed to the function is located.
// If the value is not found, return -1
