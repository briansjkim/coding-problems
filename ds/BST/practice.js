/**
 * A tree is a data structure that consists of nodes in a parent/child relationship
 *
 * Nonlinear data structure which means that there are many different paths to take
 *
 * Root - the top node in a tree
 * child - a node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root
 * parent- the converse notion of a child
 * siblings - a group of nodes with the same parent
 * leaf - a node w/ no children
 *
 * Ex) HTML DOM, the way your folders are modeled in a directory
